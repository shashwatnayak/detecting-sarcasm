training.py - takes the clean tweet data files and creates feature set for each tweet and trains it 
	      and stores the classifier in the file.
classif_all.p - classifier which is trained by the training.py is stored here
vecdict.p - This is the dictionary vector object to convert from the lists of feature value to vectors to train or test

sarcasm.py - This is the main program to check sarcasm score. It uses classif_all.p and vecdict.p to to extract featureset
       from the new input sentence and clasifies to either sarcastic or non sarcastic and gives a quantitative score


Running the program:

$ python sarcasm.py
// And enter the input to console to get output score
